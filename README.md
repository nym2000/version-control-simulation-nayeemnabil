The assignment was a great way to review all of the material that we learned throughout this week. I believe most of the cohort would be well equipped to tackle this on their own. However, while the steps were easy to follow, I did not think that the level of details in the instructions were always consistent. For example, in a certain portion for Part 3, we we were required to enter a few lines of additional commands that were not mentioned otherwise you faced unexpected scenarios that no longer worked aligned with the rest of the assignment. It was a little confusing as to whether we had to figure things on our own or explicitly follow what was provided in the steps. Regardless, it forced me to dig further to learn a few things on my own, which is a much necessary skill in software engineering anyways. Excited for the coming weeks!
